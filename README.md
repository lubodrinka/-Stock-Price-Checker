ISQA_5 - Nasdaq Stock Price Checker  User Stories Set the content security policies to only allow loading of scripts and css from your server. I can GET /api/stock-prices with form data containing a Nasdaq stock ticker and recieve back an object stockData. In stockData, I can see the stock(string, the ticker), price(decimal in string format), and likes(int). I can also pass along field like as true(boolean) to have my like added to the stock(s). Only 1 like per ip should be accepted. If I pass along 2 stocks, the return object will be an array with both stock's info but instead of likes, it will display rel_likes(the difference between the likes on both) on both. A good way to receive current price is the following external API(replacing 'GOOG' with your stock): https://finance.google.com/finance/info?q=NASDAQ%3aGOOG All 5 functional tests are complete and passing. Example usage: /api/stock-prices?stock=goog /api/stock-prices?stock=goog&amp;like=true /api/stock-prices?stock=goog&amp;stock=msft /api/stock-prices?stock=goog&amp;stock=msft&amp;like=true Example return: {"stockData":{"stock":"GOOG","price":"786.90","likes":1}} {"stockData":[{"stock":"MSFT","price":"62.30","rel_likes":-1},{"stock":"GOOG","price":"786.90","rel_likes":1}]}
